--> 1st program approach
(Here I have used C language for programming)

->  For solving this situation I have used stack using linked list.
->  For conviniency in Main, I have used concept of switch case for implementing push and pop operations.
->  Here, It is need of sequential insertion, that's why I have used if...else conditional statements.
->  For another operation of inserting the popped values, I have used another linked list.
->  I have shown output sequentially as needed in the problem statement.
