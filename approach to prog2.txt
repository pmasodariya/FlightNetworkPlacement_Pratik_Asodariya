--> 2nd program approach
(Here I have used C language for programming)

->  Here, there is a problem of circular queue, so I have used structure for creating nodes.
->  I have to use while loop to declare the winner of this circular queue.
->  For non-eliminated and eliminated kids, I have used variables for comparision.
->  Finally, when there is only one kid at the end then it'll be declared as winner.
